# example-app-router

An example that showcases custom prefixes not working on top of `next-intl` example here - https://github.com/amannn/next-intl/tree/main/examples/example-app-router

The main file to read is the [`src/i18n/routing.ts`](./src/i18n/routing.ts) to see how the prefixes are setup

But when you go to localhost:3000 in browser it redirects to `en-AU`
